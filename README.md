## About Me

Backend-focused Java developer with **1+ year of hands-on experience** building RESTful services using **Spring Boot**. Strong fundamentals in **core Java, collections, multithreading basics, JDBC, JPA/Hibernate**, and **relational databases**. I care about **clean code, performance, and correctness**—not buzzwords.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java (8–17)
* **Backend:** Spring, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA
* **API:** REST, JSON, Validation (@Valid)
* **Database:** MySQL / Oracle
* **ORM:** Hibernate / JPA
* **Build:** Maven
* **Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Postman
* **Concepts:** OOP, SOLID, Collections, Exception Handling, Transactions

## What I Actually Do Well

* Design and build **REST APIs** (controller → service → repository)
* Implement **CRUD**, pagination, validation, and exception handling
* Write **clean, readable Java** with meaningful names
* Understand **bean lifecycle**, auto-configuration, and annotations
* Debug logic issues instead of guessing

---

## Projects

> Real-world Spring Boot projects focused on backend logic, API design, and database interaction.

* REST APIs with validation and pagination
* JPA entity relationships and lifecycle handling
* Database schema design with constraints

(Details inside individual repositories.)

## Learning Focus (Current)

* Performance tuning (JPA, queries)
* System design basics (backend perspective)
* Writing production-grade APIs

---

## Principles

* No magic. If it works, I know **why**.
* Readability > clever code.
* Fix root cause, not symptoms.
